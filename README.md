### Welcome to the GitHub Page of fftcw.
I am using this code mostly for my personal purposes, and it is still full of tentative/suboptimal code, but I thought that anyway somebody might find it useful. I will soon strip it down to a more usable format and, provide some usage guidelines. If you happen to be interested in this code, drop me an email, that might be the driving force to bring this project to a "publishable" state.
